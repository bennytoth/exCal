# exCal
A browser extension that detects dates on web pages and adds them to your calendar.
Important Note: n8n MUST NOT be tracked with git. It has to be put in .gitignore! 
We have to export changes to the workflow, push them on git and the next person who wants to work on it has to import it into n8n.
