# exCal
A browser extension that detects dates on web pages and adds them to your calendar.
Important Note: n8n MUST NOT be tracked with git. It has to be put in .gitignore! 
We have to export changes to the workflow, push them on git (exCal.json).
To Work with the latest Version, Pull the json and Import it in n8n.
